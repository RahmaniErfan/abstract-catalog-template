# Curator's Guide 👑

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Abstract Folder ecosystem! This catalog is the central index for all community-contributed libraries.

## Submission Process

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Add your library** to the `libraries` array in `catalog.json`.
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with a clear title (e.g., `Add Library: My-Awesome-Library`).

## Library Requirements

To be accepted into the catalog, your library must meet the following criteria:

- **Manifest**: Must have a valid `library.json` in the root of its repository.
- **Safety**: No malicious scripts or obstructive content.
- **Documentation**: A clear `README.md` explaining the vault structure and usage.
- **Preview**: Recommended to have an `assets/preview.png` for the catalog grid.

## Safety & Vetting

All PRs are manually vetted by the maintainers. We prioritize the security and privacy of the Obsidian community. Any library found violating safety standards will be blacklisted.
